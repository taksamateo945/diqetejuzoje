Communication is essential and very important in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>interpersonal relationships</a> but sometimes it is hard to keep up a conversation, especially when you have run out of conversation starters. In this modern age and time, most people communicate actively over the phone through Facetime, phone calls, WhatsApp, Video calls, iMessage e.t.c. Coming up with what to talk about on Facetime, over the phone, or via text can make you to rack your brain if you are unprepared or have exhausted from the topics you had in mind, and in such times the conversation could take a boring turn.</p><p>So how do you know what to talk about over the phone or how do you keep a conversation on Facetime interesting and engaging? This article curates 60 different topics you can explore in your conversations either over the phone, via text, or on Facetime. But first, let us analyze some of the challenges of sustaining communication over the phone.</p><h2><b>Common Challenges Faced in Sustaining Phone Conversations</b></h2><p>It is indeed true that phones have helped the world of communication, we cannot imagine how difficult it was for people who lived in the centuries when phones did not exist, to communicate; especially lovers or friends who yearned to speak with each other. Imagine that all forms of communication lines are cut off today and we all had to go back to the times of letter writing and “birds bearing scrolls”; it will be a disaster. The importance of Phones and the ease of communication they afford us cannot be overestimated, but as with most things that have advantages; there are also disadvantages especially putting into consideration the adverse effects of decreased “physical” communication as a result of an overreliance on communicating over the phone.</p><p>It can be quite difficult keeping up with topics that enhance interest over the phone; here are some of the challenges you may encounter;</p><ul><li><b>Lack of body language:&nbsp;</b>One of the biggest challenges people face in over-the-phone communication is a lack of body language. Sometimes, a message is much more accurately passed when the people communicating can read each other’s body language. Body language is a luxury over-the-phone conversations cannot afford, and it makes optimal communication not readily accessible over the phone.</li><li><b>Misunderstandings: </b>Couples are much more likely to argue or misunderstand each other when they communicate over the phone. Certain words may not be conveyed properly which also boils down to the absence of body language. For example, Holding hands and saying Goodbye, feels different from saying Goodbye over the phone. It is easier to misunderstand certain words and tones of voice over the phone.</li><li><b>Stagnant conversations: </b>We all have experienced the awkward silence that can stretch over minutes when you run out of things to talk about, but this feels worse over the phone conversation, especially when you don’t know what else to talk about.</li><li><b>Phone Anxiety: </b>Not being able to figure out what the other person is thinking or feeling on the other side of the phone can create certain anxiety. And sometimes, some people do not fancy talking over the phone because they feel some certain kind of anxiety about phone conversations.</li><li><b>Fear of the unknown:&nbsp;</b>Not knowing the exact weather, environment, place, mindset, and setting on the other side of the phone conversation can spark a certain kind of fear and paranoia especially when discussing certain topics.</li><li><b>Running out of Topics:&nbsp;</b>It is much easier to run out of topics when talking over the phone than in physical conversations. It is also more difficult to figure out if the other party is still interested in the conversation or just acting along.</li><li><b>Awkward and long silences:&nbsp;</b>Awkward silences are a “thing” with over-the-phone conversations. Sometimes, people just keep listening to themselves breathe or stare at each other especially on face time and not knowing what else to say or do.</li><li><b>Pressure:&nbsp;</b>The pressure to say the right thing, in the right manner and in the right tone, in order not to create misunderstandings is ever-present in over-the-phone conversations. And honestly, some discussions are better in person than over the phone.</li><li><b>Network Reception Issues: </b>Especially in developing countries, Network reception and signals are a huge stumbling block for optimal over-the-phone conversations as signals can be disrupted without warning.</li><li><b>Distance: </b>Over-the-phone conversations between people who live in the same city and those who live on different continents; feel different. Especially for couples, it gets frustrating to keep on talking over the phone with a person that is so far away.</li></ul><p>From the aforementioned, the fulcrum of challenges that are faced in over-the-phone conversations is “Body Language”. The lack of body language affects a lot of things and deals differently with each different medium of the phone conversation. But, lack of body language should not kill your vibe, we are going to curate 60 different topics that you can talk about both on text, audio phone calls, and Facetime; to limit the effects of a lack of body language as well as minimize misunderstandings and pressure.</p><p>Additionally, Texting is different from Audio phone calls and also different from Video calls. You can text just about anybody but you can not Facetime just anyone; because despite the lack of body language, Video calls except for Formal meetings, are more intimate than texts or audio phone calls.</p><h2><b>Differences Between a Video, Audio, and Text Conversation&nbsp;</b></h2><p>As much as they are all over the phone conversation, Texts, Audio Calls, and Video calls are different; because the mode of delivery and reception for each of them is dynamic. Here are some highlighted differences;</p><h3><b>Audio Phone Conversation</b></h3><p>Audio phone calls have been in existence since the invention of the Telephone in the late 19th Century. They involve dialing a number, waiting for the call to be received and then you convey your message. The caller can’t see the receiver, the receiver can’t see the caller. Only voices and sounds can be heard. The advantage of an Audio phone call is that it is easier and more accessible and has been in existence for longer. Most people especially the older generation prefer Audio phone calls. Audio phone calls are also convenient and maintain privacy, in addition to the fact that they can be made or taken anywhere. They are much more universal because even in remote villages where there is no internet reception, Audio Phone calls can still be made. &nbsp;And as such Audio phone conversations are cheaper, much more convenient, and more accessible.</p><p>Voice notes are also a form of Audio phone conversation, but Voice notes require Internet services and a Social Networking Application.</p><h3><b>Text Conversations&nbsp;</b></h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>The First Text message, or properly put SMS (Short Message Service) was sent on the 3rd of December 1992. However, the concept of SMS was first developed in 1984 by a Franco-German GSM Cooperation. And so, conversations</span> via text message became rampant with the introduction of mobile phones, and then texting became “a thing” with the advent of Social Media and Social Networking sites. Text messages are convenient. Although the sender may not have an idea if his or her message has been received unless the receiver sends a reply or acknowledges receipt. Texts are also convenient for both Formal and informal conversations and can be sent any time and anywhere especially when a person is communicating discreetly.</p><p class=p1>Texts can also be sent via the internet(iMessage, Whatsapp, Emails, Messenger e.t.) or via network providers as good old SMS. If you are in a class and you want to convey a message to your friend across the hall without anybody finding out, you have to text.
